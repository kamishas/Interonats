## Dashboard Metrics

### Key Indicators
- **Total Employees:** All employees in system
- **In Onboarding:** Active workflows in progress
- **Completed:** Fully onboarded employees
- **Tasks Pending:** Total tasks requiring attention

### Alerts
- 🔴 **Immigration Expiring Soon:** Documents expiring within 30 days
- 🟠 **Licensing Required:** New states needing setup

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Why can't employee access timesheets?"
Check in this order:
1. Onboarding status must be "Completed"
2. All 5 departments must have approved
3. Classification must be verified
4. Links must be complete:
   - Billable → Client + PO
   - Non-Billable → Internal Project
   - Operational → Department

### "Workflow is stuck"
Look for:
- ❌ Blocked tasks (resolve dependencies first)
- ⏳ Tasks waiting for external action (docs, signatures)
- 📧 Pending department notifications

### "Need to update employee information"
- Currently must delete and recreate employee
- Future: Edit functionality will be added

## Tips for Success

1. **Start early:** Begin onboarding before start date
2. **Check dashboard daily:** Monitor pending tasks
3. **Communicate:** Coordinate across departments
4. **Track immigration:** Don't let documents expire
5. **New states:** Start licensing process immediately
6. **Classify early:** Determine employee type upfront
7. **Verify links:** Double-check client/PO before approval
