## 💡 Pro Tips

### ✅ Best Practices
- **Always link employees to clients via Projects** - don't skip this step
- **Set billing rates at project level** - not at employee level
- **Verify vendor before creating vendor employee** - prevents errors
- **Check total allocation = 100%** - for multi-client employees
- **Complete all 7 workflow stages** - required for timesheet access
- **Document special arrangements in Notes** - for future reference

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Creating employee without client assignment
- ❌ Missing billing rate on project
- ❌ Forgetting to link vendor employee to vendor
- ❌ Exceeding 100% allocation across clients
- ❌ Leaving workflow incomplete
- ❌ Not setting project end dates for temporary assignments

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't see Clients menu | Log out, clear cache, log back in |
| Can't create project | Verify employee & client both exist and are Active |
| Allocation error | Check total across all projects = 100% |
| Vendor link not showing | Edit employee → Select vendor → Save |
| Timesheet rate wrong | Check project assignment has billing rate set |
| Employee can't submit timesheet | Complete all 7 onboarding stages first |
