## Example Scenario: Adding H-4 Spouse Filing

Let's say you have:
- Employee: **John Doe** (H-1B visa holder)
- Need to add: **Jane Doe** (spouse with H-4 visa)

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to Immigration Management** → All Employees
2. **Click "View Details"** on John Doe
3. **Scroll to "Dependents"** section
4. **Click "Add Dependent"**
   - Name: `Jane Doe`
   - Relationship: `Spouse`
5. **Click OK** ✅

Now Jane appears in the Dependents list!

6. **Scroll up to "Filing History"**
7. **Click "Add Filing"**
8. **See the "Filing For" dropdown** (it appeared because Jane exists!)
9. **Select "Jane Doe (Spouse)"**
10. **Fill in details:**
    - Filing Type: `Extension`
    - Immigration Status: `H-4`
    - Receipt Number: `WAC1234567890`
    - Filed Date: Select date
    - Expiry Date: Select date
    - Status: `Approved`
11. **Click "Add Filing"** ✅

Done! The H-4 filing is now tracked separately from John's H-1B.

## Visual Guide

### What You'll See in the "Filing For" Dropdown:

```
Filing For
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ John Doe (Primary Employee)        │ ← Default selection
│ Jane Doe (Spouse)                  │ ← Your dependent!
│ Mike Doe (Child)                   │ ← If you add another dependent
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
John Doe    | Primary Employee        | Extension   | H-1B        | ...
John Doe    | 👥 Jane Doe             | Extension   | H-4         | ...
John Doe    | 👥 Mike Doe             | Initial     | H-4         | ...
```

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the 'Filing For' dropdown"

**Cause:** The employee doesn't have any dependents yet.

**Solution:** Add a dependent first (Step 1 above).

---

### "I can't find the Dependents section"

**Location:** Open any employee's detail view, scroll down past:
- Current Status
- Filing History  
- Green Card Process (if exists)
- **Dependents** ← Here!
- Documents

---

### "I added a dependent but can't see them in the dropdown"

**Try:**
1. Close the Add Filing dialog
2. Close the employee detail dialog
3. Re-open the employee detail
4. Try adding a filing again

The dependent list refreshes when you re-fetch the employee data.
